I am a former Street Food vendor, Graphic Designer and English teacher. Despite my relatively young age, I have packed a lot of things into my life, one of which is Makers Academy. This 12 week intensive coding bootcamp has left me energized and thrilled to be joining a fun, challenging and thriving industry. I'm looking to start as a junior web developer in an agile environment where I can continually evolve as a person, and as a professional.

###Skills | *stuff I’m good at*

**I work well in teams.**<br />
I've always been a loyal and hard working person, a true team player who has adapted to agile methodologies. In some Makers projects I was praised by my team about the honest approach in acknowledging challenges, my enthusiasm in making sure to celebrate even the smallest achievements and keep morale.

**I can code.**<br />
In the past four months I have been building web applications, connecting with API's and working with databases. All this was done in an object oriented manner, whilst employing test driven development and pairing every day. The Street Food project allowed me to fully see how powerful a Ruby on Rails app can be and also led to the wonderful realization that I can code!

Six months ago I hadn't written a single line of code but I am proud of how much I have learned in such a short space of time and I'm excited to continue building on this knowledge and honing my skills!

**I've evolved.**<br />
I was born and raised in Venezuela, where I did my Bachelor's degree whilst being an English teacher, I then spent a few years in USA where I started my own exporting company, before moving to the UK. Since being here I've realized that I needed to adopt a growth mindset, that this life is mine to shape and that, with perseverance, there is nothing I cannot achieve.
