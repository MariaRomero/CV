I am a Former Street Food Vendor and have done a little bit of everything in my short life, one of those decisions was to do Makers Academy, where I have learned design in a completely different field, my BA in Graphic Design help me when it came to front end development and finishing touches of several projects.

This intensive course has left me exhausted yet thrilled that I'll be joining a fun, challenging and thriving industry, I'm looking to start as a junior web developer in an agile environment where I will be forever evolving as a person and as a professional.

###Skills | *stuff I’m good at*

**I work well in teams.**<br />
I've always been a loyal and hard working person, I consider myself a team player, once a goal is set everybody in my team will be drag a long for the ride using an agile sprint approach, being honest about struggles and celebrating even the smallest achievements. Working on the Air BnB project as one in a team of four we continue running out own stand ups, pairing everyday and achieving goals together whilst having an amazing time.   

**I can code!.**<br />
In the past four months I have been building web applications, API's, working with data bases in an object oriented and TDD manner. The Street Food project allow me to fully see how powerful a ruby on rails app can be along with the wonderful realisation that I can code!

Six months ago I hadn't written a single line of code now I am ready to say I have definitely learn and can continue learning this thing!.

**I've evolved.**<br />
I was born and raised in Venezuela, where I did my Bachelors degree whilst being an English teacher, spent a few years in USA where I started my own exporting company, before moving to the UK, since being here I've realised that in needed to adapt a growth mindset, that this life is mine to shape and with perseverance I can get very very far.
